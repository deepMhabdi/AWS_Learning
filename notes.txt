# **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

AWS IAM is a service that lets you control who can access the AWS resource and what actions they can perform.

Basically: 
IAM = Who can log in + What they are allowed to do.

### Example (Very Simple)

I (Deep)

- Create **IAM User** → `deep-user`
- Attach **Policy** → `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`

Result:

You can **view S3 buckets**, but ❌ **cannot delete them**

| Component | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **User** | A person (developer, admin, intern) |
| **Group** | Collection of users with same permissions |
| **Role** | Temporary permission (used by services like EC2, Lambda) |
| **Policy** | Rules that define permissions (JSON format) |

| Root User | IAM User |
| --- | --- |
| Full access | Limited access |
| Very dangerous | Safe |
| Should NOT be used daily | Should be used daily |

# AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)

**Amazon S3** is an AWS service used to **store and retrieve data (files/objects)** securely from anywhere on the internet.

In simple words:

S3 = Cloud storage for files (images, videos, backups, websites, logs)

How S3 Stores Data:

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Bucket** | Folder/container that stores files |
| **Object** | The actual file (image, pdf, video) |
| **Key** | File name + path |
| **Region** | Location where bucket is created |

### Example (Very Simple)

- Bucket name: `deep-portfolio`
- File uploaded: `index.html`

Accessed as:

```
https://deep-portfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
```


# SDK(Software Development Kit)

An **SDK** is a collection of **tools, libraries, APIs, and documentation** that helps developers **build applications easily for a specific platform or service**.

In simple words:

SDK = Ready-made tools to talk to a service using code

### What is AWS SDK?

**AWS SDK** allows you to **access and manage AWS services programmatically** using programming languages.

Instead of using:

- AWS Console (UI)
- AWS CLI (commands)

You can use **code**.

Supported Languages

| SDK Name | Language |
| --- | --- |
| AWS SDK for JavaScript | JavaScript / Node.js |
| AWS SDK for Python | Python (**Boto3**) |
| AWS SDK for Java | Java |
| AWS SDK for .NET | C# |
| AWS SDK for Go | Go |
| AWS SDK for Ruby | Ruby |
| AWS SDK for PHP | PHP |

### Example (Simple)

### Without SDK (Console):

- Open AWS Console
- Upload file to S3 manually

### With SDK (Code – JavaScript):

```json
import { S3Client,PutObjectCommand }from"@aws-sdk/client-s3";

const client =newS3Client({region:"ap-south-1" });

await client.send(
newPutObjectCommand({
Bucket:"my-bucket",
Key:"test.txt",
Body:"Hello AWS"
  })
);
```
This code uploads a file to **S3**

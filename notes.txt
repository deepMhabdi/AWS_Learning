# **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

AWS IAM is a service that lets you control who can access the AWS resource and what actions they can perform.

Basically: 
IAM = Who can log in + What they are allowed to do.

### Example (Very Simple)

I (Deep)

- Create **IAM User** → `deep-user`
- Attach **Policy** → `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`

Result:

You can **view S3 buckets**, but ❌ **cannot delete them**

| Component | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **User** | A person (developer, admin, intern) |
| **Group** | Collection of users with same permissions |
| **Role** | Temporary permission (used by services like EC2, Lambda) |
| **Policy** | Rules that define permissions (JSON format) |

| Root User | IAM User |
| --- | --- |
| Full access | Limited access |
| Very dangerous | Safe |
| Should NOT be used daily | Should be used daily |

# AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)

**Amazon S3** is an AWS service used to **store and retrieve data (files/objects)** securely from anywhere on the internet.

In simple words:

S3 = Cloud storage for files (images, videos, backups, websites, logs)

How S3 Stores Data:

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Bucket** | Folder/container that stores files |
| **Object** | The actual file (image, pdf, video) |
| **Key** | File name + path |
| **Region** | Location where bucket is created |

### Example (Very Simple)

- Bucket name: `deep-portfolio`
- File uploaded: `index.html`

Accessed as:

```
https://deep-portfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
```


# SDK(Software Development Kit)

An **SDK** is a collection of **tools, libraries, APIs, and documentation** that helps developers **build applications easily for a specific platform or service**.

In simple words:

SDK = Ready-made tools to talk to a service using code

### What is AWS SDK?

**AWS SDK** allows you to **access and manage AWS services programmatically** using programming languages.

Instead of using:

- AWS Console (UI)
- AWS CLI (commands)

You can use **code**.

Supported Languages

| SDK Name | Language |
| --- | --- |
| AWS SDK for JavaScript | JavaScript / Node.js |
| AWS SDK for Python | Python (**Boto3**) |
| AWS SDK for Java | Java |
| AWS SDK for .NET | C# |
| AWS SDK for Go | Go |
| AWS SDK for Ruby | Ruby |
| AWS SDK for PHP | PHP |

### Example (Simple)

### Without SDK (Console):

- Open AWS Console
- Upload file to S3 manually

### With SDK (Code – JavaScript):

```json
import { S3Client,PutObjectCommand }from"@aws-sdk/client-s3";

const client =newS3Client({region:"ap-south-1" });

await client.send(
newPutObjectCommand({
Bucket:"my-bucket",
Key:"test.txt",
Body:"Hello AWS"
  })
);
```
This code uploads a file to **S3**

# AWS Parameter Store

**AWS Parameter Store** is a **secure storage service** used to **store configuration data and secrets** like:

- Database passwords
- API keys
- Environment variables
- Application configs

In simple words:

Parameter Store = Safe place to store secrets & config values

| Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **String** | Plain text value |
| **StringList** | Comma-separated values |
| **SecureString** | Encrypted value (uses KMS) |

## Security & Access

- Encrypted using **AWS KMS**
- Access controlled via **IAM policies**
- No hardcoding secrets in code
    - Supports versioning

## Example: Access Parameter in Node.js (SDK)

```json
import {SSMClient,GetParameterCommand }from"@aws-sdk/client-ssm";

const client =newSSMClient({region:"ap-south-1" });

const response =await client.send(
newGetParameterCommand({
Name:"/prod/db/password",
WithDecryption:true,
  })
);

console.log(response.Parameter.Value);
```

### Key Takeaway

Never hard-code secrets — use Parameter Store

# AWS Cloud shell

**AWS CloudShell** is a **browser-based command-line shell** that lets you **run AWS CLI commands directly from the AWS Console** — without installing anything on your local system.

In simple words:

CloudShell = Terminal inside AWS Console

## Example Usage

After opening CloudShell, you can directly run:

```bash
aws s3ls
```

Lists all S3 buckets in your account

# AWS EC2 (Elastic Computing Cloud)

**Amazon EC2** is a service that provides **virtual servers in the cloud** where you can run applications just like on a physical machine.

In simple words:

EC2 = Rent a computer on AWS

| Component | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Instance** | Virtual server |
| **AMI** | Amazon Machine Image (OS template) |
| **Instance Type** | CPU, RAM configuration |
| **EBS** | Storage disk |
| **Security Group** | Virtual firewall |
| **Key Pair** | SSH login key |

## Example (Very Simple)

You launch:

- AMI: Ubuntu
- Instance Type: `t2.micro`
- Storage: 8 GB
- Security Group: Allow port 22

You get:

- A Linux server on the internet

## Security in EC2

- **Security Groups** → Allow/deny traffic
- **Key Pair** → Secure login
- **IAM Role** → Access AWS services safely

# DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS converts **human-readable names** into **IP addresses**.

In simple words:

DNS = Internet phone book

### Example:

You type:

```
www.google.com
```

DNS converts it to:

```
142.250.195.46
```

### How DNS Works (Simple Flow)

1. User enters domain
2. DNS server finds IP
3. Browser connects to that IP
4. Website loads

### Real-Life Example

- You save “Mom” in your phone
- Phone internally uses the number

# Reverse Proxy

A **reverse proxy** sits **in front of servers** and forwards client requests to backend servers.

In simple words:

Reverse Proxy = Middleman between users and servers

### Example

User → **Nginx** → Backend Server

User never talks directly to backend.

### Why Reverse Proxy is Used?

- Security (hide backend)
- Load balancing
- SSL termination
- Caching
- Request routing

### Real-Life Example

- Receptionist at an office
- You don’t meet employees directly

# Ingress

**Ingress** is a **Kubernetes object** that manages **external access to services inside a cluster**.

In simple words: Ingress = Traffic rules for Kubernetes

### Example

- URL `/api` → backend service
- URL `/auth` → auth service

All handled by **Ingress**

### How Ingress Works

1. User sends request
2. Ingress Controller receives it
3. Routes to correct service

### Real-Life Example

- Security guard directing visitors
- Different departments inside building

CLEAR DIFFERENCE (VERY IMPORTANT)

| Term | Purpose | Where Used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DNS | Name → IP | Internet |
| Reverse Proxy | Request forwarding | Servers |
| Ingress | Traffic routing | Kubernetes |

## ONE-LINE MEMORY TRICK

- **DNS** → *Finds the address*
- **Reverse Proxy** → *Forwards the request*
- **Ingress** → *Decides where inside Kubernetes*

## REAL FLOW (END-TO-END)

User
↓
DNS (Route 53)
↓
Reverse Proxy (ALB / Nginx)
↓
Ingress (Kubernetes)
↓
Service → Pod


# nohup (no hang up)

`nohup` is a **Linux/Unix command** used to **run a process in the background** so that it **continues running even after you log out or close the terminal**.

In simple words:

nohup = keep program running after logout

## Example (Very Common)

### Run a Node.js app:

```json
nohup node app.js &
```

✔ App keeps running

✔ Terminal can be closed

## Stop a nohup Process

```
kill <PID>
```

Force stop:

```
kill -9 <PID>
```

## Real-Life Cloud / AWS Example

On an **EC2 instance**, you deploy a backend:

```bash
nohup npm start &
```

- SSH connection drops ❌
- App still running ✅

# SSL VS TLS

| SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) | TLS (Transport Layer Security) |
| --- | --- |
| Older protocol | New & secure |
| Deprecated | Actively used |
| Vulnerable | Strong encryption |
| Term still used | Actual protocol |

### HTTPS uses TLS, not SSL

## Common Interview Questions (Quick)

**Q: Is SSL still used?**

A: No, TLS is used; SSL term is informal.

**Q: What does HTTPS mean?**

A: HTTP over TLS encryption.

**Q: Who provides certificates in AWS?**

A: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

# AWS ECR(Elastic Container Registry)

**Amazon ECR** is a **fully managed container image registry** used to **store, manage, and deploy Docker container images** securely.

In simple words:

ECR = Docker Hub, but private and inside AWS

Key Components:

| Component | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Repository** | Stores container images |
| **Image** | Docker image |
| **Tag** | Version of image (`v1`, `latest`) |
| **Registry** | AWS-managed image store |

## Example

You build a Docker image:

```
docker build -t my-app .
```

You push it to ECR:

```
123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
```

## Typical ECR Workflow:

```
Code
 ↓
Docker Build
 ↓
PushImage → ECR
 ↓
PullImage → ECS / EKS / EC2
```

## Real-Life Use Case

- Store backend images
- CI/CD pipelines
- Microservices architecture
- Production container deployments

## ECR vs Docker Hub

| ECR | Docker Hub |
| --- | --- |
| AWS-managed | Third-party |
| IAM security | Username/password |
| Private by default | Public by default |
| Best for AWS | General use |

## Memory Trick

ECR = EC2 + Containers + Registry
